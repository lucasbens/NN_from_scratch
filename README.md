# Neural Network from Scratch

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a simple neural network implementation written from scratch using NumPy. 
The neural network is tested on two classic problems: the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.


## Neural Network Overview

The Jupyter Notebook contains a Python implementation of a basic neural network using NumPy. It showcases the architecture and training process of the neural network, which is designed for solving classification problems.

## XOR Problem

The Jupyter Notebook includes a section to address the XOR problem, illustrating how the network learns to make predictions for non-linear data. The XOR problem is a classic example of the network's capabilities.

## MNIST Dataset

The notebook demonstrates the training and testing of the neural network on the MNIST dataset. The network achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.8% on this widely-used handwritten digit recognition dataset after 50 epochs of training. This showcases the practical application of the neural network.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell. No additional dependencies are required, as NumPy is the only package used.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment.
2. Run each cell in the notebook to see how the neural network performs on the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.
3. Observe the training process and the final accuracy achieved on the MNIST dataset after 50 epochs.
